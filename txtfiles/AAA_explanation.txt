To perform the experiments, first a working version of darknet needs to be installed.
Also the database needs to be present.

1. Create a folder with a date and the experiment name
2. Adjust the sample config file for YOLOv4 to the folder to represent your experiment
3. In the 'create_all_txts.py' python file, add the locations of the datasets that will form either the training of the validation dataset.
4. Run the pytohn script to create all the needed files for the YOLOv4 training process

These files can be copied to a cluster.
Copy all the '.txt' and '.data' files to the local 'darknet/data/' folder.
Copy all the '.cfg' files to the local 'darknet/cfg/' folder.

The 'runJob*.sh' scripts can be ran to perform an experiment using sbatch.
